This script scrapes data from a website (https://www.geckoterminal.com/base/pools) using Puppeteer, a headless browser automation tool, and then processes and outputs the scraped data. Here's a summary of what the script does:

It imports necessary libraries such as Puppeteer, cron, and dotenv, and configures Puppeteer to use the StealthPlugin to prevent detection.
It defines utility functions to check for the existence of a lock file, create a lock file, and remove a lock file.
It configures dotenv to load environment variables from a .env file.
It defines an async function solScrape that launches a headless browser using Puppeteer, navigates to the specified URL, and scrapes data from the webpage.
Inside the solScrape function, it defines parsing functions to extract and process data from the webpage, such as converting string values to numeric format.
It iterates through the table rows on the webpage, extracts relevant data, and filters the data based on specific criteria.
It outputs the filtered data in a formatted JSON-like string.
It schedules the solScrape function to run periodically using cron, with a frequency of every 20 minutes.
It checks for the presence of a lock file before executing the scraping function to prevent concurrent executions.
It creates and removes the lock file before and after executing the scraping function, respectively.
Overall, the script automates the process of scraping data from a webpage, processing the scraped data, and scheduling the scraping task to run periodically.
